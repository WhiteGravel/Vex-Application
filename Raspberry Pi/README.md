**Overview** \n
This is my team's Raspberry Pi PA Consulting project.
The aim is to make people aware of how much carbon footprint their food has by an app that calculates it using data in a file.
It adds a certain amount of VAT, based on its carbon footprint, to the product, and therefore means people try and get cheaper foods with less carbon footprint.
