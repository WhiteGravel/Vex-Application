**Overview** <br>
This is my team's Raspberry Pi PA Consulting project.
The aim is to make people aware of how much carbon footprint their food has by an app that calculates it using data in a file.
It adds a certain amount of VAT, based on its carbon footprint, to the product, and therefore means people try and get cheaper foods with less carbon footprint.

**Make USB Printer Project wireless printer** <br>
We have a USB printer at home. To print a file, we need to connect to the printer. We were not able to print directly from mobile devices and to print from multiple devices we need to connect and disconnect each device to the printer.

After researching online, I found that we can use Unix CUPS module to make the Raspberry Pi as print pool/print server. Then we can send files to the pool over our home wireless network. I managed to print from devices that are connected to the wireless network which raspberry pi is connected.
